# CoffeeShopCashieringSystem
Coffee Shop Cashiering System involves the development of a web-based application using PHP and 
MySQL Database. This project provides an automated platform for businesses that serve coffee, such as coffee 
shops, so that those businesses may handle their daily sales transactions in a more efficient and productive 
manner. The program provides the user with the capability to save, manage, and retrieve the sales transactions 
associated with the specified business. The Bootstrap Framework and the AdminLTE Template were utilized 
in the development of this project to create a user interface that is both appealing and functional. It has user-friendly features and capabilities in its make-up.
